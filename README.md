# Sentiment_Analysis_with_NLP

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically on a dataset of customer (or movie) reviews. The objective is to classify the sentiment of each review as either positive or negative based on its textual content. This is a classic binary classification problem in NLP and is widely applicable in domains such as e-commerce, social media monitoring, customer feedback systems, and more.

We perform the complete pipeline of sentiment analysis which includes:
-Text preprocessing
-Feature extraction using TF-IDF
-Model training using Logistic Regression
-Performance evaluation using classification metrics and a confusion matrix
